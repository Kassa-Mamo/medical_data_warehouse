# Medical Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a medical data warehouse to collect, process, analyze, and serve data related to medical images and patient data. The project includes several modules for scraping data, processing data, and detecting medical conditions from images. It also integrates with an API to manage data queries and supports a database for structured data storage.

## Project Goals
- **Data Collection:** Gather medical images and patient data from various sources, such as telegram channels and web scraping tools.
- **Data Processing:** Clean and transform the raw data into a structured format for analysis and use.
- **Object Detection:** Implement machine learning models to detect medical conditions from images.
- **API Integration:** Develop an API to allow users to interact with the medical data warehouse, such as querying patient data and detecting conditions.
- **Database Management:** Store structured data in a database, ensuring scalability and easy access.
- **Logging:** Keep track of the operations and any issues with a dedicated logging system for troubleshooting.
- **Notebooks for Exploration:** Create Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and testing of models, ensuring a smooth workflow for data scientists.
- **Deployment & Maintenance:** Ensure that the project is easily deployable, maintainable, and extensible for future features.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (for machine learning models)
- FastAPI (for API development)
- SQLAlchemy (for database management)
- Pandas, Numpy, OpenCV (for data processing and analysis)
